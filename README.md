# leapgest

Leap (second) Gesture insight into autonomous and AI-enhanced human and animal behaviour — as a manifest, data schema files and a parser package implementation in low-start. It's a challenge to document and develop in an open and accessible way which leads to a common conclusion. We now live in a JS temple, which unwraps itself as layers of onion — in a perfect scenario a non-programmer would be intrigued by JS/json examples, freefalling through well-coded documentation while learning basics of programming and software at fingertips in a meaningful way.
